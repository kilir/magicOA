Tremendously useful function to help you deal with the Magic of the quartz c-axis opening angle thermometry.
Usage of the calibration by [1] therefore has become easier than never before. Going further, this function even provides 
a convincingly robust solution in the case of difficult data sets when it becomes tricky to extract an angle and a pressure estimate.


You can choose between different modes of operation. For details see:
